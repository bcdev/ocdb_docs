Field Modifiers,Units,Description
_###ang,does not change base field's units,"Collection angle. Append '_###ang' to the end of a field name to indicate the collection angle a measurment (such as VSF) was taken at, where '###' would be replaced by the float or integer representation of an angle in degrees. (For example, if volume scattering function is measured at a collection angle of 124 degrees, the field name would be 'vsf_124ang'.)"
_##cilo,does not change base field's units,"Confidence interval, lower, where ## is to be replaced with the percent the confidence interval was computed for. Append '_##cilo' to the end of the field name it describes to indicate the relative confidence interval at a given percentage, e.g., chl_95cilo"
_##ciup,does not change base field's units,"Confidence interval, upper, where ## is to be replaced with the percent the confidence interval was computed for. Append '_##ciup' to the end of the field name it describes to indicate the relative confidence interval at a given percentage, e.g., chl_95ciup"
_ex###,does not change base field's units,"Excitation wavelength. Append '_ex###' to the end of a field name to indicate the wavelength of excitation the measurement was taken at, where '###' would be replaced by the float or integer represenation of wavelength in nm. May be used in combination with '_em###', as such: 'cdmf_ex###_em###', where '_ex###' preceeds '_em###'."
_em###,does not change base field's units,"Emission wavelength. Append '_em###' to the end of a field name to indicate the wavelength of emission the measurement was taken at, where '###' would be replaced by the float or integer represenation of wavelength in nm. May be used in combination with '_ex###', as such: 'cdmf_ex###_em###', where '_ex###' preceeds '_em###'."
_###filt,does not change base field's units,"Append this suffix to report the filter size that observed measurements are larger than, where ### is the number of micrometers of the filter size (i.e., this is for size fractionated measurements that did not pass through the reported filter size.) Unless this suffix is used, it is assumed the methodology used a standard filter size. If combined with ###prefilt, order these 2 suffixes sequentially with ###filt first (e.g., Chl_5filt_200prefilt)."
_###prefilt,does not change base field's units,"Append this suffix to report the filter size that observed measurements are smaller than, where ### is the number of micrometers of the filter size (i.e., this is for size fractionated measurements that passed through the reported filter size.) Unless this suffix is used, measurements are assumed to be from unfiltered or whole water. If combined with ###filt, order these 2 suffixes sequentially with ###filt first (e.g., Chl_5filt_200prefilt)."
_###ppt,does not change base field's units,"Parts per thousand. Append '_###ppt' to the end of a field name to indicate the solution's concentration that a measurement was taken in, where '###' would be replaced by the concentration as a floating point number or integer. (For example, if absorbance is measured at 435.2 nm in a 35.3 ppt sodium-chloride solution, the field name would be 'abs_nacl435.2_35.3ppt'.)"
_###size,does not change base field's units,"Median bin diameter in microns. Used as a suffix for the field 'PSD'."
_stokes1,does not change base field's units,"First Stokes parameter for characterizing polarization."
_stokes2,does not change base field's units,"Second Stokes parameter for characterizing polarization."
_stokes3,does not change base field's units,"Third Stokes parameter for characterizing polarization."
_stokes4,does not change base field's units,"Fourth Stokes parameter for characterizing polarization."
